## 🎯 Key Design Principles for Pixel Art

### 1. Facade Contrast
- **Dark shop panel** vs **light brickwork** = strong visual hierarchy
- Current pixel art shows brick everywhere - needs dark panel for shop front

### 2. Brick Color
- **Light tan/beige**, not dark brown
- Consistent pattern (no flickering)
- Horizontal rows with subtle variation

### 3. Window Details
- **White frames** (not dark)
- **Stone sills** beneath windows
- **Bay window** protrusion on first floor
- Clear glass showing interior

### 4. Interior Richness
- **Dense cheese display** = visual indicator of success
- **Individual labels** = detail level for Stardew quality
- **Framed photos** = personal touch
- **Wine bottles** = clear indicator of `hasWineSelection`

### 5. Street Life
- **Wooden bench** = interactive element
- **Chalkboard** = dynamic signage
- **Bicycle** = charming detail

## 🔧 Current Pixel Art Issues vs Real Design

### ❌ Current Problems
1. **Brick Color**: Too dark, should be light tan/beige
2. **Shop Facade**: Shows brick instead of dark panel
3. **Window Frames**: Likely dark, should be white
4. **Interior Detail**: Not dense enough, missing labels, photos
5. **Street Elements**: Missing bench, chalkboard, bicycle

### ✅ What to Fix
1. Change brick color to light tan/beige palette
2. Add dark gray panel for shop front (entrance + window area)
3. Make window frames white
4. Add stone sills beneath windows
5. Increase interior detail density (more cheeses, labels, photos)
6. Add street elements (bench, chalkboard, bicycle)

## 📐 Pixel Art Specifications

### Resolution Considerations
- Current: 320×180 logical
- Display: 640×360 (2×)
- For Stardew quality: Need enough pixels for:
  - Individual cheese labels (small text)
  - Framed photos on wall (8+ small frames)
  - Chalkboard text/details
  - Bicycle details
  - Window frame details

### Detail Density
- **Cheese Display**: 20-30+ individual cheeses visible
- **Labels**: Each cheese has distinct label
- **Wall Photos**: 8+ small frames clustered
- **Street Elements**: Bench, chalkboard, bicycle all visible
