## About

You are Julien. It's July 2022. You've just taken over a small bulk grocery store in Uccle, Brussels. The previous owner left you with modest savings, loyal customers, and a decision to make: stay the course, or pivot to something new?

This game covers 42 months of running a small business—the real decisions, the burnouts, the relationships, and the dream of owning your own building.

## Features

- **Real story**: Based on the actual journey of Chez Julien in Brussels
- **French & English**: Full translation (FR/EN) with language switcher on the title screen
- **Meaningful choices**: Every decision affects your finances, stress, energy, family, and reputation
- **Burnout mechanics**: Push too hard and face real consequences
- **Building purchase goal**: Save €80,000 by month 25 to buy your building
- **Photo memories**: Unlock real photos from the shop as you progress
- **Multiple endings**: Your choices shape how the story ends

## The Challenge

Can you balance:
- 💰 **Money** - Pay bills, grow the business, save for the building
- 😰 **Stress** - Too much leads to burnout
- ⚡ **Energy** - You can't do everything alone
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family** - Success means nothing if you lose what matters
- ⭐ **Reputation** - Build a name in the neighborhood

## Testing

To run automated E2E tests (e.g. building-deadline choices in FR when you can’t afford):

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for why and what is tested.
