    "title": "📖 The Real Story Behind the Game",
    "p1": "<strong>Julien</strong> is a real person. In <strong>July 2022</strong>, he bought a struggling bulk food store in <strong>Woluwe-Saint-Pierre</strong>, Brussels, from <strong>Geneviève</strong>—the previous owner who was ready to retire. He started with almost nothing: no savings, just a dream of transforming this dying épicerie into something special.",
    "p2": "The shop came with €38,000 of \"stock\" on paper—quinoa from 2019, organic lentils that nobody wanted, cacao powder gathering dust. The épicerie sèche (dry goods) market was dying, down 23% industry-wide. But Julien saw what others didn't: the neighborhood needed a <strong>fromagerie</strong>.",
    "p3": "<strong>September 2023</strong> brought <strong>Poncho</strong>—an Australian Shepherd with endless energy who became the shop's mascot. Customers came just to see him. Kids would visit daily. He forced Julien to take walks, which turned out to be the best stress relief.",
    "p4": "In <strong>November 2023</strong>, <strong>Madame Malfait</strong> (the landlord) called with news: she was selling the building. €380,000 total, €80,000 down payment needed by <strong>July 2024</strong>. Eight months to save what seemed impossible. The countdown began.",
    "p5": "<strong>July 2024</strong>: Against all odds, Julien bought the building. His hand trembled signing the papers. No more landlord. No more vulnerability. The shop was truly his.",
    "p6": "<strong>September 2024</strong>: <strong>Lucas</strong> joined the team—young, chaotic, passionate about food. He came from the shop next door and brought energy (sometimes too much). Then in <strong>early 2025</strong>, Lucas's friend <strong>Henry</strong> arrived—calm, reliable, the perfect balance. Finally, Julien could delegate.",
    "p7": "The burnout was real. The Sunday question was real. The Swiss raclette trip, the December rushes, the AFSCA inspections—all real. This game is Julien's actual journey, compressed into 42 months.",
    "p8": "Every event in this game is based on something that actually happened."
